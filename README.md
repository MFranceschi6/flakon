Flask helper for building JSON web services.

Installation::

    $ pip install flakon


Features so far:

- a JsonBlueprint: like a Blueprint but everything is jsonified
- a SwaggerBlueprint: like JsonBlueprint but you can pass a swagger spec
  and user @operation('operationId') instead of @route
- modified operation to also make validation of the requests and responses taken the .yaml
- modified to handle swagger version 3.0
- uses Konfig to load an INI file for updating app.config


Example of usage::
```python
from flakon import SwaggerBlueprint, JsonBluePrint, create_app

api = SwaggerBlueprint('Swagger API', 'swagger' ,
                       swagger_spec='openapi.yaml')

@api.operation('getUserIds')
def get_user_ids():
    return {'one': 2}

other_api = JsonBlueprint('api', __name__)

@other_api.route('/')
def some():
    return {'here': 1}


app = create_app(blueprints=[api, other_api])
```

Now exists functions for get, post, put and delete operations also with retry::

```python
from flakon.request_utils import users_endpoint, get_request, runs_endpoint, put_request_retry
import requests
from flask import abort
...
user_id = 1
try:
    # this is a GET to http://127.0.0.1:5002/users/1/runs
    res = get_request(runs_endpoint(user_id))
    
    code = r.status_code
    if code == 204:
        return # SOMETHING
    else:
        return abort(400) # BAD REQUEST
except requests.exceptions.RequestException as err:
    print(err)
    return abort(503)     # SERVICE UNAVAILABLE

...

body = { 'id' : 1, 'age' : 20 }

try:
    # this is a PUT to http://127.0.0.1:5002/users/1 which modifies the age of the user with id 1
    res = put_request_retry(user_endpoint(), user_id, body)
    
    code = r.status_code
    if code == 204:
        return # SOMETHING
    else:
        return abort(400) # BAD REQUEST
except requests.exceptions.RequestException as err:
    print(err)
    return abort(503)     # SERVICE UNAVAILABLE
 ```
